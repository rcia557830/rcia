This program is a simple water tank system using abstraction. It has an abstract class called WaterTank that sets the basic structure, while HomeTank and BuildingTank are subclasses with their own capacities. Through a simple menu using JOptionPane, the user can choose a tank, add water, use water, and check whether the tank is full, empty, or in use, until they decide to exit the program.
